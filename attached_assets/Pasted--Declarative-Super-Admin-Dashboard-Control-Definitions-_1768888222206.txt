Declarative Super Admin Dashboard (Control + Definitions, Minimal UI Optional)

⸻

CONTEXT

You are executing Phase 4B of the WebWaka Modular Rebuild, under the governance of the WebWaka Ecosystem Constitution (v1.4 ratified).

This phase builds on Phase 4A, which already delivered the Dashboard Control Engine (webwaka-core-dashboard-control).

⚠️ Phase 4B does NOT re-implement visibility logic.
All access, visibility, and gating MUST be resolved using Phase 4A’s engine ONLY.

⸻

SOURCE OF TRUTH
	•	GitHub Org: ChangerPlanet
	•	Vercel Account: https://vercel.com/webwaka
	•	Dashboard Control Engine (already implemented):
	•	webwaka-core-dashboard-control

⸻

TARGET REPOSITORY

Repository to CREATE (if not already existing)

webwaka-suite-dashboard-superadmin

If the repo already exists:
	•	Reuse it
	•	Do NOT create a duplicate

⸻

SCOPE OF PHASE 4B (VERY IMPORTANT)

THIS PHASE IS ABOUT:
	•	Declarative dashboard definitions
	•	Super Admin-specific menu structure
	•	Control metadata (sections, groups, actions)
	•	Optional minimal UI shell (ONLY if useful for validation)

THIS PHASE IS NOT:
	•	A full product UI
	•	A routing framework
	•	A permissions engine
	•	A feature-flag engine
	•	An entitlement engine

Those already exist.

⸻

CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❗ ABSOLUTE RULE

ALL visibility and access MUST be resolved via Phase 4A’s engine, using:
	1.	Permissions (from webwaka-core-permissions)
	2.	Entitlements (from webwaka-core-entitlements)
	3.	Feature flags (from webwaka-core-feature-flags)
	4.	Dashboard resolution (webwaka-core-dashboard-control)

Phase 4B ONLY DECLARES dashboards.
It NEVER decides visibility itself.

⸻

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES

1️⃣ Dashboard Declarations (PRIMARY OUTPUT)

Implement Super Admin dashboard declarations using the Phase 4A contract.

Include (at minimum):

Top-Level Sections
	•	Platform Governance
	•	Partners & Tenants
	•	Pricing & Plans
	•	Incentives & Affiliates
	•	Feature Flags & Experiments
	•	Branding / Whitelabel
	•	Infrastructure & Deployments
	•	Audit & Compliance
	•	AI / Automation (future-gated)

Each section MUST declare:
	•	Required permissions
	•	Required entitlements
	•	Required feature flags (if any)
	•	Optional time bounds

📌 Do NOT hardcode roles
📌 Do NOT assume admin = access

⸻

2️⃣ Dashboard Declaration Files

Produce structured declaration files such as:

/dashboards/superadmin.dashboard.ts
/dashboards/superadmin.sections.ts

Each declaration must be:
	•	Pure data
	•	Deterministic
	•	Serializable
	•	Compatible with Phase 4A engine

⸻

3️⃣ Resolution Integration (Read-Only)

Use Phase 4A APIs to:
	•	Resolve dashboard visibility
	•	Generate dashboard snapshots
	•	Verify snapshot integrity
	•	Evaluate from snapshot (offline-safe)

⚠️ You are consuming Phase 4A — not extending it.

⸻

4️⃣ Optional Minimal UI (STRICTLY OPTIONAL)

If included:
	•	Use minimal React or similar
	•	No routing complexity
	•	No stateful logic
	•	Purpose: visual validation only

The UI MUST:
	•	Consume resolved dashboard output
	•	Never contain access logic
	•	Never hide/show elements manually

If unsure → skip UI

⸻

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
	•	Language: TypeScript
	•	Architecture: Pure declarations + composition
	•	Determinism: Required
	•	Tenant isolation: Required
	•	Offline safety: Supported via snapshots

⸻

CI / VERCEL NOTES (DO NOT PANIC)
	•	This repo MAY fail Vercel build if UI is absent
	•	That is EXPECTED and ACCEPTABLE
	•	Do NOT add fake build artifacts
	•	Do NOT change Vercel settings

⸻

HARD STOP CONDITION (MANDATORY)

Provide a test that proves:

“Given a Super Admin context, permissions, entitlements, and feature flags, the system produces a deterministic, explainable dashboard structure using Phase 4A — both online and from snapshot.”

Test must show:
	•	A section hidden due to missing permission
	•	A section hidden due to entitlement
	•	A section gated by feature flag
	•	Snapshot generation + verification
	•	Offline evaluation equivalence

⸻

EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS

❌ No Partner dashboard
❌ No Tenant dashboard
❌ No pricing logic
❌ No incentives logic
❌ No database mutations
❌ No background jobs
❌ No AI execution
❌ No deployment orchestration

⸻

REQUIRED FINAL REPORT

When complete, provide:
	1.	Summary of Declarations
	2.	List of Sections + Gating Rules
	3.	Proof of Phase 4A Consumption
	4.	Hard Stop Test Results
	5.	Final Commit SHA

⸻

STOP RULE

⛔ STOP after submission
⛔ Await explicit authorization before Phase 4C
